# How it Works
The Interactive Data Visualization web application is built using HTML, CSS, Chart.js, and Anime.js. Here's how it works:

 # HTML Structure
 The HTML structure defines a canvas element with the ID myChart, which serves as the container for the bar chart.
# CSS 
CSS styles are applied to create a responsive and visually appealing chart container. The container has a maximum width of 600px and is centered horizontally.
# JavaScript Functionality
Chart.js is used to create the bar chart. Sample data for the chart is provided in the JavaScript code.
Anime.js is used to apply smooth animations to the data points. The animations alternate between growing and shrinking the data points.
The Chart.js options include a responsive design and an interactive tooltip that displays the value of each data point when hovered.
